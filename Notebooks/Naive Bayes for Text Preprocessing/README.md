## Naive bayes algorithm for document classification

Performing naive bayes algorithm for document classification into the given classes.

## DATA DESCRIPTION:
Name : naivetext.csv
Description : Contains sentences in each line followed by its sentiment (positive / negative)

**Output:** The given sentences classified as either positive or not negative.

## MODELLING AND EVALUATION:
ML Algorithm used : Naive Bayes

Metric - Since the target variable is a categorical value, we have used binary crossentropy for the loss metrics.

CONCLUSION:
We have used Naive classifier to classify a given list of sentences into either positive or negative texts.
